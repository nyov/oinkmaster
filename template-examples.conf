# Here are a bunch of sample template definitions, later followed
# by examples how to use them.

# Tag by src for 10 seconds by adding the string

# If you want to append stuff at the very end of a rule, you could do 
# something like this:
# define_template add_src_tagging \
#  "\)\n$" | \
#  "tag: host,src,10,seconds;)\n"


# Take text given as argument and append to the rule's "msg" string.
define_template append_msg \
  "\b(msg\s*:\s*".+?)"\s*;+s*" | \
  "$1%ARG1%";"


# Add thresholding of type "both", count 30, seconds 60.
define_template add_threshold \
  "\b(sid\s*:\s*\d+\s*;)" | \
  "$1 threshold:type both,track by_dst,count 30,seconds 60;"


# Add thresholding with values for count and seconds given as arguments 
# when using the template.

# Change classtype to the one specified as argument.
define_template change_classtype \

# Convert an active alert rule to a drop rule

# Remove "flow" statement.

# Switch $EXTERNAL_NET/$HOME_NET in a rule watching for stuff from 
# $EXTERNAL_NET to $HOME_NET, so it becomes $HOME_NET to $EXTERNAL_NET.
define_template check_outgoing \
  "(.+) \$EXTERNAL_NET (.+) \$HOME_NET (.+)" | \

# become "any", regardless of their current values.
define_template src_dst_any_any \

# Just like disablesid but also add a comment line before the disabled 
# rule.

# Delete an active rule by removing it from the file completely.

# Tag by src for the number of seconds given as argument. Also include 
# this number in a string appended to the rule's msg.

# Now some examples how to use the above templates:


# Add tagging by src to SID 1324.
# use_template add_src_tagging 1324


# Append the string " - added text!" to the msg of SID 1324.
# use_template append_msg 1324 " - added text!"


# Add thresholding with values hardcoded into the add_threshold template.
# use_template add_threshold 1326


# Add thresholding with count value given as first argument
# and seconds value given as second argument.
# use_template add_threshold_with_values 1326 "10" "30"


# Change the classtype to "some-other-classtype" in sid 1324 and 1325.
# use_template change_classtype 1324,1325 "some-other-classtype"


# Make sid 1324 a drop rule.
# use_template make_drop 1324


# Remove the "flow" statement from sid 1324.
# use_template remove_flow 1324


# Disable all rules that are using the "uricontent" keyword.
# use_template disable_by_keyword * "uricontent"


# Reverse $EXTERNAL_NET and $HOME_NET in SID 1324 to watch only
# for outgoing attacks of this kind. 
# use_template check_outgoing 1324


# Make both src and dst "any" in SID 1326.
# use_template src_dst_any_any 1326


# Disable rule 1323, and also add a comment line above it
# in the rules file.
# use_template disable_with_comment 1323 "I don't like this rule"


# Add 60 seconds tagging to SID 528, and also add this
# information to its msg string.
# use_template tag_src_and_append_msg 528 "60"


# This will delete (not disable) the SIDs 1323, 1324 and 1326.
# use_template delete_rule 1323, 1324, 1326


# This will delete ALL active rules. Not a very useful example :)
# use_template delete_rule *
