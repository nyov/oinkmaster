Intro
~~~~~

Oinkmaster GUI (oinkgui.pl in the contrib directory) is my very first 
attempt at creating a graphical user interface. It was written just for 
fun. The result is not the prettiest interface you've seen, but it 
actually works. It runs on Unix systems and also on Windows with 
ActivePerl. Send feedback to Andreas Östling <andreaso@it.su.se>.



How to install
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This GUI is simply a front-end used to create the right command line and
then execute Oinkmaster with it. In other words, oinkmaster.pl can be run 
without the GUI but the GUI can not be run without oinkmaster.pl.
It may be easiest if you make sure you have Oinkmaster (without the GUI) 
up and running first, although it's not required. See Oinkmaster's own
INSTALL and README (and README.win32 of you're on Windows) for more 
information. 

The GUI is written in Perl and requires the Perl Tk module.
If you're on Unix, get the latest version from 
http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/NI-S/. At the time of writing, 
http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/NI-S/Tk-800.024.tar.gz is probably the one 
you'll want. Unpack it and run "perl Makefile.pl && make && make install" 
and you should be able to start the GUI by running oinkgui.pl.
(If you're on *BSD, the TK module is probably available in your ports 
system.)

If you're on Windows with ActivePerl, you do not need any extra module
since everything is probably installed already. Should the Tk Perl module 
be missing, you can install it with "ppm install Tk" from the command 
line.If you want a non-ugly interface when browsing for directories, you need 
to install the Win32::FileOp module. This is strongly recommended and is 
as simple as typing "ppm install Win32::FileOp" on the command line.
Then you just need to copy the GUI perl file to some suitable 
directory and execute it. Using the GUI under Cygwin is untested and may 
or may not work.



Usage
~~~~~~

When you start the GUI for the first time, all required files/directories 
will not be automatically set (although some of them may be).
All entries under the "Required files and directories" tab must 
be set correctly or you will not be able to do anything. When they are set 
correctly (i.e. when all the labels have turned green), you are ready to 
go. The files/directories under the "Optional files and directories" 
tab are not required and if you leave a field empty, that option will
simply not be used.

When all required fields are set, it's recommended to push the 
"Test configuration" button. This will execute Oinkmaster and make it test 
its configuration and then exit. If the configuration test is successful,
you should be ready to update the rules.

When you're happy with all the filename entries and options, you probably 
want to push the "Save config" button. All GUI settings will then be save 
to a configuration file which you can load later with then "Load config" 
button. It's also loaded automatically on startup.

You can try placing the mouse pointer over a button or filename entry and 
a short help message will be displayed under the big black output window.
