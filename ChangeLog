v0.7 - 2002XXXX
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
o Don't print warning when using "-e" in quiet mode.
o "-p" is now not just obsolete, but invalid.
o Support file://... in URL. File will be copied from the
  local filesystem. Suggested by aidan.carty@entropy.ie.
o sid-msg.map will now be updated by default.
o A few minor cleanups.
o Warn instead of exit in case of invalid lines in the config file.



v0.6 - 20020706
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
o Rules that are disabled by default in the rules distribution
  will now NOT be re-enabled by Oinkmaster by default, finally.
  I.e. "-p" is obsolete. If you want to enable those rules you now
  have to use "-e".
o A couple of minor documentation updates.



v0.5 - 20020506
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
o Fixed bug where all filenames would not always be printed.
o Fixed minor whitespace idiocy.
o Print which rules that are being preserved or enabled (for rules that
  are commented out by default) when running in verbose mode.
o SID dup warnings will no longer be printed when running in quiet mode.
o Document example where running silently as a cron job, only
  sending e-mail when there were updates available.
o Document that using -p is usually a good idea.



v0.4 - 20020422
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
o More or less rewritten from scratch.
o The file rules.ignore has been renamed to oinkmaster.conf, which contains
  more than just the sids to disable (have a look at it).
o Slightly improved error checking.
o Better output format (or at least it has changed).
o Oinkmaster will now also update other files (and print changes in them) than
  *.rules and classification.conf. The default is now *.rules, *.conf, *.config,
  *.txt and *.map so we also update the MIB and sid-msg.map files for example.
  Files to be updated is defined by a regexp in oinkmaster.conf so this can
  easily be changed.
o Removed several stupid command line options.
o Print warning message if two (or more) rules share the same SID.
o Added option -p to preserve disabled rules in downloaded archive.
o "file" and "sid" keywords in oinkmaster.conf are now invalid.
  They are instead called "skipfile" and "disablesid" (to avoid confusion
  when possibly adding new keywords in the future).
o Instead of specifying one "disablesid X" per line, you can now also use
  comma-separated lists, e.g. "disablesid 1,2,3,4,42".
  Same goes for the skipfile keyword.
o Various minor bug fixes and tweaks.
o Some documentation updates.



v0.3 - never (was rewritten and became v0.4)

v0.2 - 20010906
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  to configure maximum number of download retries before giving up.

o Fixed a few stupid bugs.
o Default URL is now http://www.snort.org/downloads/snortrules.tar.gz
