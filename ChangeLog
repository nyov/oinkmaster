v0.8 - 200xxxxx
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
o Multi-line rule support.
o Temporary directory can now be specified in oinkmaster.conf.
o deleted.rules is skipped in default oinkmaster.conf ("skipfile deleted.rules")
o A bunch of Win32/Cygwin fixes, mostly from Ueli Kistler <iuk@gmx.ch>
  To avoid problems when running under Win32/Cygwin, you should only use
  Cygwin-style paths (e.g. "/cygdrive/c/foo" instead of "c:\foo").
o Better check for duplicate SIDs (check is done across all files now).
o Slightly modified format when printing results 
  (hopefully easier to read when there are a large number of changes).



v0.7 - 20030217
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
o oinkmaster.conf will now be searched for in /usr/local/etc/ by
  default (instead of in the current directory).
  You will have to put it there or use the -C argument.
o Don't print warning when using "-e" in quiet mode.
o "-p" ("preserve comments") is now not just obsolete, but invalid.
o New argument, "-Q" to run in über-quiet mode.
  Same as quiet mode except that it doesn't print the "None." stuff
  when printing results.
o Support file://<filename> syntax in URL specification.
  Rules archive will be copied directly from the local filesystem
  (which must have been put there ahead of time).
  Suggested by aidan.carty@entropy.ie.
o sid-msg.map will now be updated by default.
o Warn instead of exit in case of invalid lines in the config file.
o Added possibility to modify sids, using the "modifysid" keyword
  in the config file (use with care).
o Added makesidex.pl by Jerry Applebaum <JApplebaum@APTEGRITY.com>
  to contrib section. Useful to new Oinkmaster users who already
  have many rules commented out and don't want to create oinkmaster.conf
  manually from scratch. It strips out the sids from everything you've
  commented out and writes them out in a format that can be appended to
  oinkmaster.conf.
o Added addmsg.pl (by myself) to contrib section.
  It's a script that will parse your oinkmaster.conf for "disablesid" lines
  and add to them their SID message as a #comment.
o Fixed bug related to deleted rules printout.
o Default URL is now 
  http://www.snort.org/dl/rules/snortrules-stable.tar.gz.
o In verbose mode, print warning if a file in the downloaded archive is empty.
o Don't require write permission in the output directory when running with -c.
  Pointed out by arjones@simultan.dyndns.org.
o Don't care about trailing whitespaces for non-rule lines (to avoid getting
  a diff where the same line appears to have been both added and removed when
  only a traling whitespace has been removed etc).
o Allow umask to be specified in oinkmaster.conf.
o Many internal cleanups and minor bug fixes.



v0.6 - 20020706
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
o Rules that are disabled by default in the rules distribution
  will now NOT be re-enabled by Oinkmaster by default, finally.
  I.e. "-p" is obsolete. If you want to enable those rules you now
  have to use "-e".
o A couple of minor documentation updates.



v0.5 - 20020506
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
o Fixed bug where all filenames would not always be printed.
o Fixed minor whitespace idiocy.
o Print which rules that are being preserved or enabled (for rules that
  are commented out by default) when running in verbose mode.
o SID dup warnings will no longer be printed when running in quiet mode.
o Document example where running silently as a cron job, only
  sending e-mail when there were updates available.
o Document that using -p is usually a good idea.



v0.4 - 20020422
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
o More or less rewritten from scratch.
o The file rules.ignore has been renamed to oinkmaster.conf, which contains
  more than just the sids to disable (have a look at it).
o Slightly improved error checking.
o Better output format (or at least it has changed).
o Oinkmaster will now also update other files (and print changes in them) than
  *.rules and classification.conf. The default is now *.rules, *.conf, *.config,
  *.txt and *.map so we also update the MIB and sid-msg.map files for example.
  Files to be updated is defined by a regexp in oinkmaster.conf so this can
  easily be changed.
o Removed several stupid command line options.
o Print warning message if two (or more) rules share the same SID.
o Added option -p to preserve disabled rules in downloaded archive.
o "file" and "sid" keywords in oinkmaster.conf are now invalid.
  They are instead called "skipfile" and "disablesid" (to avoid confusion
  when possibly adding new keywords in the future).
o Instead of specifying one "disablesid X" per line, you can now also use
  comma-separated lists, e.g. "disablesid 1,2,3,4,42".
  Same goes for the skipfile keyword.
o Various minor bug fixes and tweaks.
o Some documentation updates.



v0.3 - never (was rewritten and became v0.4)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



v0.2 - 20010906
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
o Added optional "-a <attempts>" argument (which is passed to wget's "-t" argument)
  to configure maximum number of download retries before giving up.
o Warning message will be printed if there is any invalid line in the ignore file.
o Fixed a few stupid bugs.
o Default URL is now http://www.snort.org/downloads/snortrules.tar.gz
  PLEASE be aware of the following description of the rules in the above archive:
  "This is a CVS snapshot of the snort signatures every 30 minutes.
  NOTE: These signatures may only work with snort-current"



v0.1 - 20010726
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
o Initial release.
