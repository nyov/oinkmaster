.TH OINKMASTER 1 "January 14, 2004"
.SH NAME
.B oinkmaster
\- update and maintain Snort signatures
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B oinkmaster.pl -o
.I outdir
[options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Oinkmaster is simple tool that helps you keep your Snort rules current 
with little or no user interaction. It downloads a tarball containing the
new rules and can then enable, disable or even make arbitrary 
modifications to specified rules before updating your local rules files.
It will also tell you the exact changes from your previous rules.
.SH OPTIONS
The only required argument to Oinkmaster is
.B -o
.I outdir
where
.I outdir
is the directory to put the new rules in. This should be where you keep 
your rules locally. The downloaded files will be compared to the ones in 
here before possibly overwriting them.
.PP
Optional arguments:
.IP "\fB-b \fIdir\fP
If the rules have been modified, a tarball of your old rules will be put 
in
.I directory
before overwriting them with the new files. No backup if done if no file 
has changed or if Oinkmaster is running in careful mode.
.IP "\fB-c
Run in careful mode. This means that Oinkmaster will only check for 
updates and print them, but not overwrite or update anything.
.IP "\fB-C \fIcfg\fP
Use this configuration file instead of the default.
If not specified, oinkmaster.conf will be looked for in
/etc/ and then /usr/local/etc/.
You can specify multiple
.B -C
.I cfg
to load multiple configuration files.
They will be loaded in order of appearance on the command line an if an 
option is redefined, it overrides the previous value.
.IP "\fB-e
Enable rules that are disabled by default in the downloaded rules archive 
by removing all the leading "#" from them. If there are any disabled rules 
in the archive, they will stay that way unless you use this option. 
Remember that they are disabled for a reason (they may be broken), so use this 
option with care.
.IP "\fB-h
Show valid command line arguments with short descriptions
.IP "\fB-i
Enable interactive mode. You will be asked to approve the changes (if 
any) before updating anything.
.IP "\fB-q
Run in quiet mode. Nothing is printed unless there were changes in the 
rules or if there were any error messages.
.IP "\fB-Q
Run in super-quiet mode. This is the same as
.B -q
but even more quiet when printing the results (the "None." stuff is not 
printed).
.IP "\fB-r
Check for rules files that exist in the output directory
.I (outdir)
but not in the 
downloaded rules archive, i.e. files that may have been removed from the 
distribution archive.
.IP "\fB-T
Test the syntax of the configuration file(s) and then exit.
.IP "\fB-u \fIurl\fP
Download the rules archive from
.I url
instead of from the location specified in the configuration file.
It must start with file://, ftp://, http://, https:// or scp:// and
end with ".tar.gz". It must contain a directory called "rules", holding
all the rules files.
.IP "\fB-U \fIfile\fP
Variables that exist in downloaded snort.conf but not in
.I file
will be added to this one, right after any other variables it may contain. 
Modified variables are not merged, only new ones. This is usually your 
production copy of snort.conf.
.IP "\fB-v
Run in verbose mode.
.IP "\fB-V
Show version and exit.
.SH EXAMPLES
Download rules archive from default location specified in oinkmaster.conf 
and put the new rules in /etc/rules/:
.PP
.nf
\fB    oinkmaster.pl -o /etc/rules \fP
.fi
.PP
Grab rules archive from local filesystem but do not print anything unless
it contains updated rules:
.PP
.nf
\fB    oinkmaster.pl -u file:///tmp/rules.tar.gz -o /etc/rules -q \fP
.fi
.PP
Download rules archive from default location, make backup of old rules if
there were updates, and send output by e-mail. (Note however that if you 
plan on distributing files with Oinkmaster that could be considered 
sensitive, such as Snort configuration files containing database 
passwords, you should of course not send the output by e-mail without 
first encrypting the content.) Also make backup first if anything is 
updated:
.PP
.nf
\fB    oinkmaster.pl -o /etc/rules -b /etc/snort/rules 2>&1 | \fP\\
\fB    mail -s "subject" user@example.com
.fi
.PP
Load settings from two different files, use scp to download rules archive 
from a remote host where you have put the rules archive, merge variables 
from downloaded snort.conf, and send results by e-mail only if anything 
changed or if there were any error messages. It assumes that the "mktemp" 
command is available on the system:
.PP
.nf
\fB    TMP=`mktemp /tmp/oinkmaster.XXXXXX` && \fP\\
\fB    (oinkmaster.pl -C /etc/oinkmaster-global.conf \fP\\
\fB    -C /etc/oinkmaster-sensor.conf -o /etc/rules \fP\\
\fB    -U /etc/snort.conf \fP\\
\fB    -u scp://user@example.com:/home/user/rules.tar.gz \fP\\
\fB    > $TMP 2>&1; if [ -s $TMP ]; then mail -s "subject" \fP\\
\fB    you@example.com < $TMP; fi; rm $TMP) \fP
.fi
.PP
.SH BUGS
If you find a bug, report it by e-mail to the author. Always include as 
much information as possible.
.SH HISTORY
The first version of this script was called arachnids_upd and was 
released in early 2001. It was designed to work with the ArachNIDS Snort 
rules but as times changed it was redesigned to work with the official 
Snort rules instead, and the new name became Oinkmaster.
