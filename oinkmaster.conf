# URL to the rules archive to download (or copy).
# Must begin with http://, ftp:// or file:// and end with .tar.gz

# Use this one if you're running the latest release version of Snort
# (or following snort-STABLE):
url = http://www.snort.org/dl/rules/snortrules-stable.tar.gz

# Use this one *only* if you're following snort-CURRENT.
# This ruleset usually only works with recent develop versions of Snort!
#url = http://www.snort.org/dl/rules/snortrules-current.tar.gz

# Or if you prefer to download the rules archive from outside Oinkmaster,
# you can then point to the file on your local filesystem by using
# file://<filename>, for example:
#url = file:///tmp/snortrules.tar.gz

# The PATH to use during execution.
# 'tar' and 'gzip' must be found, and also 'wget' if fetching from a remote host.
path = /bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin

# Files in the archive matching this regexp will be checked
# for changes, and then updated or added if needed.
# (You can then choose to skip individual files by specifying
# the "skipfile" keyword below".)
# Normally you shouldn't need to change this one.

# Files to totally skip (i.e. never update them or check for changes) #

# Ignore (skip) "local.rules" from the rules archive by default, since we might
# have put some local rules in our own "local.rules", and we don't want
# it to get overwritten by the empty one from the archive after each update.

skipfile local.rules

# Also skip snort.conf from the rules archive by default since we don't
# want to overwrite our own snort.conf if we have it in the same directory as
# the rules. (If you have your own ("real") snort.conf in another directory, it
# may be really nice to check for changes in this file though, especially since
# new variables are sometimes added!)

skipfile snort.conf

# SIDs to modify after each update (only for the skilled/stupid/brave!) #
# Don't use it unless you really have to. The expression is currently   #
# simply passed to eval "...". You have been warned.                    #
# If you just want to disable SIDs, please skip this section and have a #
# look at the "disablesid" keyword below.                               #
#                                                                       #
# Syntax: modifysid SID expression                                      #
#         where expression is a perl s/replacethis/withthis/ regexp     #
#         substitution. Use with care and remember that each rule       #
#         ends with a \n.                                               #

# Example to enable a rule (in this case SID 12345) that is disabled by default:
# modifysid 12345 s/#alert/alert/

# But you probably don't want it to be whitespace-sensitive, so this is better:
# modifysid 12345 s/\s*#\s*alert/alert/

# Or to add "tag" stuff at the end of SID 1325:
# modifysid 1325 s/\)\s*$/ tag: host, src, 300, seconds;\)/

# SIDs to comment out after each update     #

# Syntax:  disablesid SID                   #
# or:      disablesid SID1, SID2, SID3, ... #
#############################################

# SID 1-6 are disabled by default, just as an example.

# You can specify one SID per line:
disablesid 1
disablesid 2
disablesid 3

# And also as comma-separated lists:
disablesid 4, 5, 6
