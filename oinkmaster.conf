# URL to the rules archive.
# Must begin with http://, ftp:// or file://

# Use this one if if you're running the latest release version of Snort
# (or following snort-STABLE):
url = http://www.snort.org/dl/signatures/snortrules.tar.gz

# Use this one *only* if you're following snort-CURRENT.
# This ruleset usually only works with recent develop versions of Snort!
#url = http://www.snort.org/dl/signatures/snortrules-current.tar.gz

# The $PATH to use during execution (wget, tar and gzip must be found).
path = /bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin

# Files in the archive matching this regexp will be checked
# for changes, and then updated or added if needed.
# (you can then choose to skip individual files by specifying
# the "skipfile" keyword below").
# Normally you shouldn't need to change this.

########################################################################
# Files to totally skip (i.e. never update them or check for changes). #
# Syntax: skipfile filename                                            #
# or:     skipfile filename1, filename2, filename3, ...                #

# Ignore (skip) "local.rules" from the rules archive by default, since we might
# have put some local rules into our own "local.rules", and we don't want
# it to get overwritten by the empty one from the archive after every update.

skipfile local.rules

# Also skip snort.conf from the rules archive by default, since we don't
# want to overwrite our own snort.conf if we have it in the same directory as
# the rules. (If you have your own snort.conf in another directory, it may be
# really nice to check for changes in this file though, especially since new
# variables are sometimes added!)

skipfile snort.conf




###############################################
# SIDs to comment out after each update.      #
# Syntax:  disablesid SID                     #
# or:      disablesid SID1, SID2, SID3, ...   #
###############################################

# SID 1-6 are disabled by default, just as an example.

# You can specify one SID per line:
disablesid 1
disablesid 2
disablesid 3

# And also as comma-separated lists:
disablesid 4, 5, 6
