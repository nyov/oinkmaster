# URL to the rules archive to download (or copy).
# Must begin with http://, https://, ftp://, file:// or scp://
# and end with .tar.gz

# Use this one if you're running the latest release version of Snort
# (or following snort-STABLE):
url = http://www.snort.org/dl/rules/snortrules-stable.tar.gz

# Use this one *only* if you're following snort-CURRENT.
# This ruleset usually only works with recent develop versions of Snort!
# url = http://www.snort.org/dl/rules/snortrules-current.tar.gz

# Or if you prefer to download the rules archive from outside Oinkmaster,
# you can then point to the file on your local filesystem by using
# file://<filename>, for example:
# url = file:///tmp/snortrules.tar.gz

# Example to use scp to copy the rules archive from another host.
# Only OpenSSH is tested.
# url = scp://user@somehost.example.com:/somedir/snortrules.tar.gz

# If you need to specify an ssh key (passed to -i <key> to the scp command)
# you can specify it here or add an entry in ~/.ssh/config for the 
# oinkmaster user as described in the OpenSSH manual
# Note that it's strongly recommended that the public key on the remote
# host is restricted to only permit the copy, especially if you use an
# empty passphrase on the private key.
# There is no reason why Oinkmaster should be able to do anything else
# on the remote host except copy the rules archive.
# scp_key = /home/oinkmaster/oinkmaster_privkey


# The PATH to use during execution.
# 'rm', 'tar' and 'gzip' must be found, and also 'wget' if fetching rules
# from a remote host (all with optional .exe suffix).
# Assume UNIX style by default:
path = /bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin

# Example if running native Win32 or standalone Cygwin:
# path = c:\oinkmaster;c:\oinkmaster\bin

# Example if running standalone Cygwin and you prefer Cygwin style path:
# path = /cygdrive/c/oinkmaster:/cygdrive/c/oinkmaster/bin


# Temporary directory to use. This directory must exist when starting
# (Oinkmaster will then create a temporary sub directory in here).
# Keep it as a #comment if you want to use the default.
# The default will be checked for in the environment variables TMP,
# TMPDIR or TEMPDIR, or otherwise "/tmp" if none of them was set.

# Example for UNIX:
# tmpdir = /home/oinkmaster/tmp/

# Example if running native Win32 or Cygwin:
# tmpdir = c:\tmp

# Example if running Cygwin and you prefer Cygwin style path:
# tmpdir = /cygdrive/c/tmp


# The umask to use during execution if want it to be something else
# than the current value when starting Oinkmaster
# (keep it commented out to use the current value).
# For example:
# umask = 0027


# Files in the archive matching this regexp will be checked
# for changes, and then updated or added if needed.
# (You can then choose to skip individual files by specifying
# the "skipfile" keyword below".)
# Normally you shouldn't need to change this one.
# (But if you do, make sure it's still a valid regexp.)
update_files = \.rules$|\.config$|\.conf$|\.txt$|\.map$


# If the number of rules files in the downloaded archive matching the
# 'update_files' regexp is below min_files, or if the total number
# of rules in it is below min_rules, the archive is regarded as
# broken and the update is aborted with an error message.
# Both are set to 1 by default (i.e. the archive is only regarded as
# broken if it's totally empty).
# min_files = 1
# min_rules = 1

# Ignore (skip) "local.rules" from the rules archive by default, since we might
# have put some local rules in our own "local.rules", and we don't want
# it to get overwritten by the empty one from the archive after each update.
skipfile local.rules

# Also skip snort.conf from the rules archive by default since we don't
# want to overwrite our own snort.conf if we have it in the same directory as
# the rules. (If you have your own ("real") snort.conf in another directory, it
# may be really nice to check for changes in this file though, especially since
# new variables are sometimes added!)
#skipfile snort.conf

# The file deleted.rules contains rules that have been deleted from other files.
# There is usually no point in watching it, but it may sometimes contain useful
# comments about *why* certain rules are deleted.
# Remove the comment to skip this file.
# skipfile deleted.rules

# SIDs to modify after each update (only for the skilled/stupid/brave).  #
# Don't use it unless you have to. There is nothing that stops you from  #
# modifying rules in such ways that they become invalid.                 #
# If you just want to disable SIDs, please skip this section and have a  #
# look at the "disablesid" keyword below.                                #
#                                                                        #
# You may specify several modifysid directives for the same SID, and     #
# you may also specify a list of SIDs on which the substitution should   #
# be applied. Note that #comments are NOT allowed on "modifysid" lines.  #
#                                                                        #
# Syntax: modifysid SID "replacethis" | "withthis"                       #
# or:                                                                    #
# Syntax: modifysid SID1, SID2, SID3, ... "replacethis" | "withthis"     #
#                                                                        #
# The strings within the quotes will simply be passed to a               #
# s/replacethis/withthis/ statement in Perl, so they must be valid       #
# regular expressions.                                                   #
#                                                                        #

# Example to enable a rule (in this case SID 1325) that is disabled by
# default, by simply replacing "#alert" with "alert".
# modifysid 1325 "#alert" | "alert"

# But since it's actually regexps, it's better to make sure we only replace
# the "#alert" if it's at the beginning of the line and also don't care about
# possible whitespaces.
# modifysid 1325 "^\s*#\s*alert" | "alert"

# Example to add "tag" stuff to SID 1325.
# modifysid 1325 "sid:1325;" | "sid:1325; tag: host, src, 300, seconds;"

# Example to make SID 1378 a 'drop' rule (valid if you're running Snort_inline).
# modifysid 1378 "^\s*alert" | "drop"

# Example to replace first occurrence of $EXTERNAL_NET with $HOME_NET in SID 302.
# Remember that the strings are regular expressions, so you must
# escape special characters like $.
# modifysid 302 "\$EXTERNAL_NET" | "\$HOME_NET"

# You can also specify that a substitution should apply on several SIDs.
# modifysid 302,429,1821 "\$EXTERNAL_NET" | "\$HOME_NET"

# You can take advantage of the fact that it's regular expressions and
# do more complex stuff. This example (for Snort_inline) adds a 'replace'
# statement to SID 1324.
# modifysid 1324 "(content\s*:\s*"\/bin\/sh"\s*;)" | "$1 replace:"\/foo\/sh";"
