Installation instructions for Oinkmaster v0.4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

o Untar/unpack the distribution file into some suitable directory, for 
  example /usr/local. This will create a directory called oinkmaster-version.

o Edit the file oinkmaster.conf. There are some options you may want to
  change. Here you will also tell Oinkmaster which SIDs or files you want to
  disable or ignore. As you will see, a few things are skipped by default.
  See the README file and the notes in oinkmaster.conf for more information.

  If you already have several rules commented out (or removed) from your current
  rules, you need to add those SIDs to oinkmaster.conf manually, or they will be
  enabled after the first update. Note that Oinkmaster will enable all rules by
  default, even those that are commented out by default in the rules archive, 
  unless -p is specified.

o Decide in which directory you want to put the new rules. Since you
  probably already have Snort up and running, you should use your existing
  rules directory (you should really consider using a separate directory for
  the rules from snort.org though, so you don't accidentaly overwrite any local
  files).

  If you for example have your Snort rules stored in
  /usr/local/snort/snort.org-rules/, you can now update those by running:

  ./oinkmaster.pl -o /usr/local/snort/snort.org-rules/

  You REALLY should check out the entire README before doing anything though.
  You may also run oinkmaster.pl -h for more usage information and options.
