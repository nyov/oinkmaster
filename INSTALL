Installation instructions for Oinkmaster v0.3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

o Untar/unpack the distribution file in some temporary directory:
  tar zxvf oinkmaster-version.tar.gz
  This will create a directory called oinkmaster-version.

o Move this directory to some suitable location, for example /usr/local/:
  mv oinkmaster-version /usr/local/

o Check out the file oinkmaster.conf.
  Here you can put SIDs of the rules you want do disable after each update.
  You can also skip entire files.
  As you will see, the entire file "local.rules" is skipped by default.
  See the README file (or the notes in oinkmaster.conf) for more information.

o Decide in which directory you want to put the new rules. Since you 
  probably already have Snort up and running, you should use your existing
  rules directory (consider using a separate directory for the rules from
  snort.org though, unless you're already doing so).

  If you for example have our Snort rules stored in 
  /usr/local/snort/snort.org-rules/, you can now update those by running:

  cd /usr/local/oinkmaster-version
  ./oinkmaster.pl -o /usr/local/snort/snort.org-rules/

  Don't forget that these files must be included from your Snort configuration
  file.

o That's it!
  Now you can start figuring out which rules you want to disable (if any at all).
  Although you REALLY should check out the README file first. It contains some
  very important information.

  You may also run oinkmaster.pl -h for more usage information and options.

  Check out http://www.snort.org/ for more information about Snort.
