Installation instructions for Oinkmaster v1.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

o Put oinkmaster.pl in some suitable directory, for example 
  /usr/local/bin/. Put oinkmaster.conf in /usr/local/etc/ (this is where 
  oinkmaster will search for it by default). If you want to have 
  oinkmaster.conf in some other directory, you must run Oinkmaster with 
  the -C argument. Make sure that the ownership/permission on the above 
  files are suitable for your environment.

o Edit oinkmaster.conf, or at least have a look at it to make sure 
  everything looks ok. There are some options you may want to change 
  before running Oinkmaster, although the defaults should work for most 
  people. Here you will then also tell Oinkmaster which SIDs or files you 
  want to disable/enable/modify. If you already have several rules 
  commented out (or removed) in your current rules, you must add the 
  SIDs of those to oinkmaster.conf so they don't get re-enabled after 
  each update. Remember that after switching to Oinkmaster for updating 
  the rules, all permanent modifications to the rules must be done by 
  editing oinkmaster.conf, not by editing the rules files directly.

o Decide in which directory you want to put the new rules. Since you 
  probably already have Snort up and running, you should use the 
  directory where you keep the official rules. It's a very good idea to 
  create a backup of it first. You must run Oinkmaster as a user that has 
  read/write access to your rules directory and all rules files in it. It 
  should not be a privileged user. (The user you run Snort as, if 
  different than the Oinkmaster user, usually only needs read access.)
  For example, if the directory is /etc/snort/rules/, you can now 
  update those rules by running:

  oinkmaster.pl -o /etc/snort/rules

  You should really check out the entire README before doing anything 
  though. You may also run oinkmaster.pl -h for more usage information and 
  options. See the FAQ if you need to setup proxy configuration.
