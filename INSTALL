Installation instructions for Oinkmaster v0.4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

o Untar/unpack the distribution file in some temporary directory:
  tar zxvf oinkmaster-version.tar.gz
  This will create a directory called oinkmaster-version.
  Move this directory to some suitable location, for example /usr/local/.

o Check out the file oinkmaster.conf. There are some options you may want to
  change. Here you will also tell Oinkmaster which SIDs or files you want to
  disable or ignore. As you will see, a few things are skipped by default.
  See the README file and the notes in oinkmaster.conf for more information.

o Decide in which directory you want to put the new rules. Since you 
  probably already have Snort up and running, you should use your existing
  rules directory (you should REALLY consider using a separate directory for
  the rules from snort.org though, unless you're already doing so, so you 
  don't accidentaly overwrite any local files).

  If you for example have your Snort rules stored in 
  /usr/local/snort/snort.org-rules/, you can now update those by running:

  ./oinkmaster.pl -o /usr/local/snort/snort.org-rules/

o That's it!
  Now you can start figuring out which rules you want to disable (if any at all).
  If you already have several rules commented out (or removed) from your current
  rules, you need to add those SIDs to oinkmaster.conf manually, or they will be
  enabled after the first update. You really should check out the README file first.
  It contains some very important information.

  You may also run oinkmaster.pl -h for more usage information and options.
