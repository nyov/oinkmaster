Installation instructions for Oinkmaster v0.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

o Untar/unpack the distribution file in some temporary directory:
  tar zxvf oinkmaster-version.tar.gz
  This will create a directory called oinkmaster-version.

o Move this directory to some suitable location, for example /usr/local/:
  mv oinkmaster-version /usr/local/

o Check out the file rules.ignore.
  SID 1, SID 2 and SID 3 are disabled by default, just as a demonstration.
  Remove/comment these numbers, or simply create an empty rules.ignore file.
  The entire file "local.rules" is also skipped by default.
  (See README for more information)

o You can now grab the rulesets from the default URL by running:
  cd /usr/local/oinkmaster-version
  ./oinkmaster.pl -o /somewhere/snort.org-rules/
  This will place the rulesets in the directory /somewhere/snort.org-rules/.
  Don't forget to include these rules files from your Snort configuration file.

o That's it!
  Now you can start figuring out which rules you want to disable (if any at all).
  Although you REALLY should check out the README file first. It contains some
  very important information.

  You may also run oinkmaster.pl -h for more usage information and options.

  Check out http://www.snort.org/ for more information about Snort.
