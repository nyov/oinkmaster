Installation instructions for Oinkmaster v0.7
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

o Put oinkmaster.pl in some suitable directory, for example /usr/local/bin/
  Put oinkmaster.conf in /usr/local/etc/ (this is where oinkmaster will search
  for it by default).

o Edit the file oinkmaster.conf. There are some options you may want to
  change before even starting. Here you will then also tell Oinkmaster which
  SIDs or files you want to disable or ignore. As you will see, a few things
  are disabled/ignored by default.

  If you already have several rules commented out (or removed) in your current
  rules, you need to add the SIDs of those to oinkmaster.conf manually (or check
  out the contrib directory for a help script) or they will be re-enabled after
  each update (check out the contrib/ directory). Some rules may be commented out 
  by default in the rules distribution, and as of Oinkmaster 0.6 they will stay
  that way. If you want to enable them, you have to use "-e". Note that those
  rules are however commented out for a reason (they may not even work!), so be 
  careful. Also note that possible local modifications you've done inside the
  official Snort rules files will be lost since the files will be overwritten by
  the new versions from the downloaded rules archive after each update.

o Decide in which directory you want to put the new rules. Since you probably
  already have Snort up and running, you should use your existing rules
  directory. If you for example have the official Snort rules files stored in
  /snort/snort.org-rules/ you can now update those by running:

  ./oinkmaster.pl -o /snort/snort.org-rules/

  You REALLY should check out the entire README before doing anything though.
  You may also run oinkmaster.pl -h for more usage information and options.
  See wget's manual page (http://www.gnu.org/manual/) if you need to setup
  proxy configuration etc.
