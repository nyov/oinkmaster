Installation instructions for Oinkmaster
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1) Put oinkmaster.pl in some suitable directory, for example 
   /usr/local/bin/. Put oinkmaster.conf in /etc/ or /usr/local/etc/
   (this is where Oinkmaster will search for it by default). If you want 
   to have oinkmaster.conf in some other directory, you must run 
   Oinkmaster with the -C argument. Make sure that the 
   ownership/permission on the above files are suitable for your 
   environment. You may also want to copy the man page (oinkmaster.1) to 
   something like /usr/local/man/man1/.


2) Edit oinkmaster.conf that you copied in step 1). The defaults should 
   be fine for most users, although one thing you must change is
   "url = <url>", which specifies the location of the rules archive.
   The URL to use depends on which version of Snort you run and also what 
   type of rules you want to use. Some may require registration. See Q1 in 
   the FAQ for more information.

   In oinkmaster.conf you will then also tell Oinkmaster things like 
   which SIDs or files you want to disable/enable/modify/ignore. If you 
   already have several rules commented out (or removed) in your current 
   rules, you must add the SIDs of those to oinkmaster.conf so they 
   don't get re-enabled after each update (there is a help script for 
   that, see makesidex.pl in the contrib directory). Remember that after 
   switching to Oinkmaster for updating the rules, all permanent 
   modifications to the rules must be done by editing oinkmaster.conf, 
   not by editing the rules files directly.


3) Decide in which directory you want to put the new rules. If you 
   have Snort up and running already, you should use the directory where 
   you keep the rules files. It's a very good idea to create a backup of 
   it first. You must run Oinkmaster as a user that has read/write access 
   to your rules directory and all rules files in it. It should however 
   *NOT* be a privileged user such as root! 
   Never run Oinkmaster as root.


o Done! 
  Assuming your rules directory is /etc/snort/rules/, you can now update 
  those rules by running:

  oinkmaster.pl -o /etc/snort/rules

  You should really check out the entire FAQ and README before doing 
  anything though. You may also run oinkmaster.pl -h to list all 
  available command line options. They are described in more detail in 
  the Oinkmaster manual page. See the FAQ if you need to setup proxy 
  configuration.
