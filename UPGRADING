Usually just overwrite the old oinkmaster.pl file with the new one.

- When upgrading to v0.4 or newer you should know that the file oinkmaster.conf
  is now used for configuration. It's probably easiest to start with the
  new default config and apply your old customization to it.
  The "file" and "sid" keywords have been renamed to "skipfile" and
  "disablesid" respectively. Also, a few command line switches were
  removed since they're not needed anymore.
  Please read the new documentation.
