Usually you just overwrite the old oinkmaster.pl file with the 
new one and then run as usual.
Here are a few notes about issues in some specific versions:


- When upgrading to v0.8 and you're using the 'modifysid' keyword in v0.7, 
  you should know that the arguments to 'modifysid' are now regarded as 
  regular expressions, which may (or may not) mean that you have to adjust 
  your arguments to reflect this.
  There are also a few new options you may want to specify in your
  oinkmaster.conf (see the default one for explanations and examples), 
  although none of them are required.
  

- When upgrading to v0.7, you should know that oinkmaster.conf will now
  be searched for in /usr/local/etc/ by default (instead of in the current
  directory). You will have to put it there or use the -C argument.


- When upgrading to v0.4 or newer you should know that the file oinkmaster.conf
  is now used for configuration. It's probably easiest to start with the
  new default config and apply your old customization to it.
  The "file" and "sid" keywords have been renamed to "skipfile" and
  "disablesid" respectively. Also, a few command line switches were
  removed since they're not needed anymore.
  Please read the new documentation.
