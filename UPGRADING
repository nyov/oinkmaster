Usually just overwrite the old oinkmaster.pl file with the new one.

- When upgrading to v0.4 you should know that the file oinkmaster.conf
  is now used for configuration. It's probably easiest to start with the
  default one and append your old customization to it.
  Also, a few command line switches were removed since they're not
  needed anymore. Please also read the new documentation.
