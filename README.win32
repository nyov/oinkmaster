Introduction
------------

There are three known ways to run Oinkmaster under Windows:

- ActivePerl

- Cygwin from within a Cygwin shell

- Cygwin but not from within a Cygwin shell (i.e. standalone)

Which method you choose is mostly a matter of taste.
You can find installation instructions for each one of these below, 
followed by a few general useful notes about Oinkmaster/Windows.



ActivePerl
----------

- Install Oinkmaster as usual by following the INSTALL file.

- Download ActiveState's ActivePerl from 
  http://www.activestate.com/Products/ActivePerl/ and do a regular
  installation. It contains all required Perl modules.

- You need a few GNU utilities compiled for native Win32.
  The required binaries are "rm.exe", "gzip.exe", "tar.exe", and "wget.exe".
  The easiest may be to download the latest package from 
  http://unxutils.sourceforge.net/ which contains all of these, among 
  others. Simply copy the previously mentioned  binaries from this package 
  into a suitable directory.

- Edit oinkmaster.conf and modify the 'path' option so it at least
  contains the directory with the GNU utilities you installed above,
  and optionally the path to the ActivePerl perl.exe binary.
  The path should be specified as regular msdos style, so comment out the 
  unix style path (which is active by default) and add something like this:

  path = c:\perl\bin;c:\oink\gnu-bin\

  But of course change the paths so they point to whatever your 
  directories are called.

- Done!

Now you should be able to run Oinkmaster. (You probably want to start a 
cmd.exe shell first so you see what's going on.) You run it by calling 
perl.exe with oinkmaster.pl and its options as argument, for example:

c:\perl\bin\perl c:\oink\oinkmaster.pl -C c:\oink\oinkmaster.conf -o c:\oink\rules

Again, your paths may be different.



Cygwin from within a Cygwin shell
---------------------------------

- Install Oinkmaster as usual by following the INSTALL file.

- Download and install Cygwin from www.cygwin.com.
  Make sure to also include the packages gzip, Perl, tar and wget.

- Done!

Now you should be able to run Oinkmaster.
You run it by first starting Cygwin (i.e. executing a shell like bash)
and then simply calling oinkmaster.pl with the requested arguments.
Assuming that Oinkmaster and the rules directory is in /etc/snort/, 
you can use something like:

/etc/snort/oinkmaster.pl -o /etc/snort/rules

Or if you need to specify a path that is not inside the Cygwin directory
structure, just use something like:

/etc/snort/oinkmaster.pl -o "c:\snort\rules"

Or the same but using Cygwin style:

/etc/snort/oinkmaster.pl -o /cygdrive/c/rules



Cygwin but not from within a Cygwin shell (i.e. standalone)
-----------------------------------------------------------

This assumes that you want to run Oinkmaster using Cygwin, but
without first starting a Cygwin shell.

- Install Oinkmaster as usual by following the INSTALL file.

- Download and install Cygwin from www.cygwin.com.
  Make sure to also include the packages gzip, Perl, tar and wget.

- Make sure the 'path' option in oinkmaster.conf includes the
  directory/directories containing the required Cygwin binaries.
  You can specify the path as either msdos style or Cygwin style, e.g.:

  path = c:\cygwin\bin;d:\somedir\bin

  or the same but as Cygwin style:

  path = /cygdrive/c/cygwin/bin:/cygdrive/d/somedir/bin

  (You usually only need to specify the path to Cygwin's "bin" directory,
   e.g. "path = c:\cygwin\bin".)

- Done!

Now you should be able to run Oinkmaster. (You probably want to start a 
cmd.exe shell first so you see what's going on.) You run it by 
calling the Cygwin perl.exe with oinkmaster.pl and its options as 
argument. For example, if Cygwin is installed in c:\cygwin and Oinkmaster 
and the rules directory is in c:\oink\, you can run:

c:\cygwin\bin\perl c:\oink\oinkmaster.pl -C c:\oink\oinkmaster.conf -o c:\oink\rules



A few useful notes regarding Oinkmaster and Win32
-------------------------------------------------

o It's best to start Oinkmaster by calling the Perl interpreter
  with oinkmaster.pl and it's options as argument. 
  Depending on your setup, it may also work by simply calling oinkmaster.pl
  directly though.

o You must always specify the -C argument and point to your oinkmaster.conf 
  file since it's looked for in a UNIX directory by default.

o When using Cygwin (standalone or from within a Cygwin shell) you should
  be able to use both msdos style paths (i.e. c:\foo) or Cygdrive style
  paths (i.e. /cygdrive/c/foo) for everything, but remember that backslashes
  needs to be quoted ("c:\foo") or escaped (c:\\foo) when starting from a 
  Cygwin shell.

o You will probably need an editor that can handle UNIX style
  newlines (i.e. \n and not \r\n) to edit the Oinkmaster-related files.

o You may want to download EagleX from Engage Security
  (http://www.engagesecurity.com/products/eaglex/)
  which among many other things contains Oinkmaster (ready to run as a 
  standalone Cygwin program without requiring a full Cygwin installation) 
  and a graphical interface to it. 

o Oinkmaster is not as well tested on Windows as on UNIX, 
  so please report any issues you may find.
